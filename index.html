    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
      I was born and raised on an unincorporated territory of the Unites States called Guam. I moved to Louisiana in 2000 there I worked as a dental assistant full time and Walmart part time for about 4 years. I moved to Georgia in 2004 and lived there for about 10 years while in Georgia I worked for a company that was contracted through the military for around 5 years. After that contract phased out I was hired at one of the local hospitals while earning my BS in Information Technology and Systems Management. Soon after graduation in 2014, my family and I relocated to Bellevue, WA which is where we still live at today. I currently work as a Slots Systems Technician for the Snoqualmie Casino and now I am here at Code Fellows hoping to become a future developer.

        <li>3. Guam was a colony of Spain for over 300 years because of that there was a strong spanish influence so the Chamorro language is confusingly similar to the Spanish language, youâ€™d actually think you were in a province in Spain.</li>       
        <li>4. Guam is the nearest US soil to Asia. The reason there are hundreds of thousands of visitors from Korea, Japan, Taiwan and the Philippines to Guam is because the flight to the island is only 3.5 hours.</li>    
        <li>5. The people of Guam just love Spam. When this canned meat brand turned 75 years old, TIME magazine featured in an article a few unknown facts that included how much Guamanians consumed in a year.</li>      
        <li>6. The people are considered Guamanians, the Indigenous people are considered Chamorro. The proud people of Guam are Guamanians. Chamorro is the oldest civilization in the North Pacific. Local Chamorro culture and traditions are well-preserved and are today a unique mixture of many countries that colonized the beautiful island over a span of several hundred years.</li>        
        <li>7. The people of Guam are very religious and a good 85% of the population are Catholic.</li>
